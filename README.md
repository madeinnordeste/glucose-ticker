## Motivation
I wanted to have a glanceable indicator of my glucose while I was working.   
Without having to take out a reader, or [asking my Google Assistant](https://git.io/nightscoutstatus).  

There are similar solutions, but they put your glucose in the tray so the icon is very small (16px).  
 Glucose ticker takes advantage of larger (32px) icons on the Windows 10 taskbar.

## Supported systems
Windows 10 is the targeted system. You'll also need a Nightscout site.  
This project uses Electron, so you could probably port it to Linux and Mac. But I haven't tried it myself. :)
